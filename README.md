****Mileage Predictor Project****
Mileage PredicThis project aims to predict vehicle mileage (miles per gallon) using 
machine learning models basedtor Project.This project aims to predict vehicle mileage
(miles per gallon) using machine learning models based on various input features
such as vehicle specifications and driving conditions. By analyzing patterns in the data,
the predictor provides accurate mileage estimates for different types of vehicles, helping
users optimize fuel efficiency. The project includes data preprocessing, model selection, 
training, and evaluation stages. Features like engine size, weight, and horsepower are 
utilized to improve prediction accuracy. Various regression models are tested, including 
linear regression and decision trees. The final model is selected based on performance 
metrics such as Mean Absolute Error and R-squared value. This project serves as a practical 
tool for both vehicle owners and manufacturers to better understand and improve fuel efficiency.
